# Task 15.2: Content Security Policy Configuration - Summary

## Overview

Implemented strict Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to protect the CollectIQ frontend application from XSS attacks, clickjacking, and unauthorized resource loading. This implementation satisfies Requirement 12.2.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Middleware CSP Configuration (`middleware.ts`)

Added comprehensive CSP header generation with the following security measures:

**Key CSP Directives:**

- ✅ `script-src 'self'` - **No inline scripts allowed** (critical XSS protection)
- ✅ `frame-ancestors 'none'` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- ✅ `object-src 'none'` - Disallows plugins (Flash, Java, etc.)
- ✅ `default-src 'self'` - Restricts all resources to same origin by default
- ✅ `form-action 'self' https://*.amazoncognito.com` - Allows OAuth redirects to Cognito

**Whitelisted Trusted Domains:**

- API domain (from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`)
- Cognito domain (from `NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_DOMAIN`)
- AWS services (`*.amazonaws.com` for S3)
- CloudFront CDN (`*.cloudfront.net`)

**Dynamic Configuration:**

- CSP headers are built dynamically based on environment variables
- Automatically extracts API domain from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`
- Includes `upgrade-insecure-requests` in production only

### 2. Additional Security Headers

Implemented comprehensive security headers in middleware:

```typescript
- Content-Security-Policy: [dynamic CSP string]
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy: camera=(self), microphone=(), geolocation=(), interest-cohort=()
```

### 3. Next.js Config Headers (`next.config.mjs`)

Added static security headers for all routes:

```typescript
- X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: on
- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### 4. Documentation (`SECURITY_HEADERS.md`)

Created comprehensive documentation covering:

- CSP directive explanations
- Whitelisted domains and rationale
- Testing procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- Compliance mapping to requirements

### 5. Test Suite (`__tests__/middleware/csp.test.ts`)

Implemented 14 unit tests verifying:

- ✅ Frame-ancestors set to 'none'
- ✅ Inline scripts disallowed
- ✅ AWS domains whitelisted for images
- ✅ Cognito domains whitelisted for connections
- ✅ API domain whitelisted
- ✅ Form actions allowed to Cognito
- ✅ Object embeds disallowed
- ✅ Base URI restricted to self
- ✅ Upgrade insecure requests in production
- ✅ Inline styles allowed (for Tailwind CSS)
- ✅ All additional security headers configured correctly

**Test Results:** ✅ All 14 tests passing

## Security Benefits

### XSS Protection

- No inline scripts prevents injection attacks
- All JavaScript must be in external files
- Event handlers must use addEventListener

### Clickjacking Protection

- `frame-ancestors 'none'` prevents iframe embedding
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` provides fallback protection

### Data Leakage Prevention

- Strict referrer policy limits information disclosure
- Permissions policy restricts browser feature access

### HTTPS Enforcement

- HSTS header forces HTTPS for 2 years
- `upgrade-insecure-requests` in production

## Files Modified

1. **apps/web/middleware.ts**
   - Added `getCSPHeader()` function for dynamic CSP generation
   - Added `applySecurityHeaders()` function to apply all security headers
   - Modified middleware to apply headers to all responses

2. **apps/web/next.config.mjs**
   - Added `headers()` async function with static security headers
   - Configured HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and other headers

## Files Created

1. **apps/web/SECURITY_HEADERS.md**
   - Comprehensive documentation of CSP implementation
   - Testing procedures and troubleshooting guide
   - Compliance mapping

2. **apps/web/**tests**/middleware/csp.test.ts**
   - 14 unit tests for CSP directives
   - Tests for additional security headers

## Compliance

This implementation satisfies:

- ✅ **Requirement 12.2**: Strict CSP with no inline scripts
- ✅ **Requirement 12.3**: Security headers (X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, etc.)
- ✅ **Requirement 12.4**: Prevent clickjacking with frame-ancestors
- ✅ **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against XSS, clickjacking, and injection attacks

## Testing Verification

```bash
pnpm --filter web test __tests__/middleware/csp.test.ts
```

**Result:** ✅ 14/14 tests passing

## Browser Verification

To verify CSP in browser:

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for CSP violation warnings
4. Check Network tab → Headers to verify CSP header

## Environment Variables Required

The CSP configuration uses these environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` - API domain for connect-src
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_DOMAIN` - Cognito domain for connect-src and form-action
- `NODE_ENV` - Determines if upgrade-insecure-requests is included

## Next Steps

The CSP is now fully configured and tested. Future considerations:

- Monitor CSP violation reports in production
- Add CSP reporting endpoint if needed
- Adjust directives if new third-party services are added
- Consider adding nonce-based CSP for inline styles in future

## Notes

- Inline styles are allowed (`'unsafe-inline'`) because Tailwind CSS requires them
- Camera permission is allowed for card scanning feature
- All other browser features (microphone, geolocation) are disabled
- CSP is enforced in both development and production environments
