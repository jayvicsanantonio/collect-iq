title: CollectIQ — Market Opportunity
---

# Offer

CollectIQ is a multi-agent AI platform for trading card collectors that combines real-time pricing, authenticity assessment, and vault management into one seamless experience. Users can scan or photograph a Pokémon or other trading card to receive:

• Real-time market valuation fused from eBay, TCGPlayer, and PriceCharting APIs.

• Authenticity scoring using Amazon Rekognition for visual features and Amazon Bedrock for reasoning.

• Portfolio vaulting, revaluation alerts, and long-term trend tracking for collectors and investors.

CollectIQ bridges the gap between manual card valuation and professional grading by offering AI-driven insights at consumer scale, turning casual hobbyists into informed collectors.

# Why Now?

The timing for CollectIQ aligns with explosive growth in collectibles and alternative investments, alongside new AI capabilities that enable precise visual and market analysis.

Key factors include:  
• Trading card and collectibles markets are expanding, with strong retail demand and investment interest \[1\]\[6\].  
• Real-time marketplace data and APIs enable live pricing aggregation.  
• Counterfeits in secondary markets increase the need for authenticity verification (supports an AI-first approach).  
• AI maturity: Computer vision (Rekognition) + LLM reasoning (Bedrock) enable explainable evaluation workflows.  
• Pokémon TCG content and digital engagement remain high, sustaining volatility and attention \[7\].

# Proof & Signals

The trading card ecosystem is expanding rapidly, validated by strong financial and community metrics.

• Retail signals: Walmart reported trading card sales up ~200% (Feb 2024 → Jun 2025) and Pokémon card sales \>10× YoY; broader retail momentum persists \[6\].

# The Market Gap

Despite the scale, current solutions focus primarily on static price listings or manual valuation. The gaps include:

• Lack of condition-aware and authenticity-aware valuations.  
• No unified system that merges vaulting, pricing, and AI verification.  
• Fragmented data silos—collectors can’t cross-reference across marketplaces.  
• Expensive or inaccessible grading services that discourage casual collectors.  
• Low trust in secondary markets due to counterfeit risk.  
CollectIQ directly addresses these pain points with explainable AI-based trust signals and dynamic valuations.
