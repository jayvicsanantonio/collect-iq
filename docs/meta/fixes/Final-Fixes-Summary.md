# Final Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Card Name Not Being Extracted ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The pricing agent was receiving `cardMeta.name` as undefined, causing it to search for "Unknown Card"

**Root Cause**: The Step Functions was passing `cardMeta` but not populating the `name` field from the Rekognition OCR results

**Solution**: Updated the pricing agent to extract the card name from OCR blocks if not provided in metadata

**Changes Made**:

- `services/backend/src/agents/pricing-agent.ts`
  - Added OCR extraction logic to find the largest, most confident text block
  - Uses size × confidence scoring to identify the card name
  - Falls back to "Unknown Card" only if no OCR data available

**Code**:

```typescript
// Extract card name from OCR blocks (largest + most confident text)
const sortedBlocks = [...event.features.ocr].sort((a, b) => {
  const sizeA = (a.boundingBox?.height || 0) * (a.boundingBox?.width || 0);
  const sizeB = (b.boundingBox?.height || 0) * (b.boundingBox?.width || 0);
  const confidenceA = a.confidence || 0;
  const confidenceB = b.confidence || 0;
  return sizeB * confidenceB - sizeA * confidenceA;
});
cardName = sortedBlocks[0]?.text || 'Unknown Card';
```

### Issue 2: DynamoDB Access Denied ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Pricing agent Lambda couldn't query DynamoDB for cached pricing data

**Error**:

```
AccessDeniedException: User is not authorized to perform: dynamodb:Query
```

**Root Cause**: The pricing agent Lambda role didn't have DynamoDB permissions

**Solution**: Added IAM policy to grant DynamoDB access

**Changes Made**:

- `infra/terraform/envs/hackathon/lambdas.tf`
  - Added `aws_iam_role_policy` resource for pricing agent
  - Granted Query, GetItem, PutItem, UpdateItem permissions
  - Includes access to table and all indexes

**Code**:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "pricing_agent_dynamodb" {
  name = "${local.name_prefix}-pricing-agent-dynamodb"
  role = module.lambda_pricing_agent.role_name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect = "Allow"
      Action = [
        "dynamodb:Query",
        "dynamodb:GetItem",
        "dynamodb:PutItem",
        "dynamodb:UpdateItem"
      ]
      Resource = [
        module.dynamodb_collectiq.table_arn,
        "${module.dynamodb_collectiq.table_arn}/index/*"
      ]
    }]
  })
}
```

### Issue 3: Pokémon TCG API Search Failures ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Exact card name matches were failing due to OCR variations

**Solution**: Implemented wildcard search and fallback logic

**Changes Made**:

- `services/backend/src/adapters/pokemontcg-adapter.ts`
  - Changed from exact match to wildcard search (`name:*Pikachu*`)
  - Added fallback to simplified search if exact search fails
  - Cleans special characters from card names
  - Enhanced logging to show search queries and results

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build Backend

```bash
cd services/backend
pnpm run build
```

**Expected Output**: ✅ Build completed successfully

### 2. Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
cd ../../infra/terraform/envs/hackathon
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

**What Gets Updated**:

- ✅ Pricing agent Lambda (new code with OCR extraction)
- ✅ Pricing agent IAM role (DynamoDB permissions)
- ✅ Step Functions state machine (if not already updated)

### 3. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check Lambda function
aws lambda get-function --function-name collectiq-hackathon-pricing-agent

# Check IAM policy
aws iam get-role-policy \
  --role-name collectiq-hackathon-pricing-agent-role \
  --policy-name collectiq-hackathon-pricing-agent-dynamodb
```

---

## Testing

### Test 1: Upload a Card

1. Go to the web app
2. Upload a clear image of a Pokémon card
3. Wait for processing

### Test 2: Check CloudWatch Logs

```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/collectiq-hackathon-pricing-agent --follow
```

**Look for these SUCCESS indicators**:

```json
✅ "Extracted card name from OCR"
   - cardName: "Pikachu" (or actual card name)
   - confidence: 0.95

✅ "Searching Pokémon TCG API"
   - searchQuery: "name:*Pikachu*"

✅ "Found X cards from Pokémon TCG API"
   - cardNames: ["Pikachu", "Pikachu V", ...]

✅ "Pokémon TCG adapter fetched X comps"

✅ "Pricing data fetched successfully"
   - compsCount: 15
   - valueMedian: 5.00
```

### Test 3: Verify DynamoDB Access

The logs should NOT show:

- ❌ "AccessDeniedException"
- ❌ "not authorized to perform: dynamodb:Query"

If caching works, you'll see:

- ✅ "Returning cached pricing result" (on subsequent requests)

---

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fixes

```
❌ "Card name not provided, pricing may be inaccurate"
❌ "Fetching pricing data" → cardName: "Unknown Card"
❌ "AccessDeniedException: not authorized to perform: dynamodb:Query"
❌ "No pricing data available from any source"
```

### After Fixes

```
✅ "Extracted card name from OCR" → cardName: "Pikachu"
✅ "Fetching pricing data" → cardName: "Pikachu"
✅ "Searching Pokémon TCG API" → searchQuery: "name:*Pikachu*"
✅ "Found 10 cards from Pokémon TCG API"
✅ "Pokémon TCG adapter fetched 30 comps"
✅ "Pricing data fetched successfully" → valueMedian: 5.00
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### If card name extraction still fails:

**Check OCR quality**:

```bash
# Look for Rekognition logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/collectiq-hackathon-rekognition-extract --follow
```

Should show:

- ✅ "Front image features extracted successfully"
- ✅ ocrBlockCount: > 0

**Improve image quality**:

- Use clear, well-lit images
- Card should be straight and flat
- Remove background clutter

### If DynamoDB access still fails:

**Verify policy is attached**:

```bash
aws iam list-role-policies \
  --role-name collectiq-hackathon-pricing-agent-role
```

Should include: `collectiq-hackathon-pricing-agent-dynamodb`

**Check policy content**:

```bash
aws iam get-role-policy \
  --role-name collectiq-hackathon-pricing-agent-role \
  --policy-name collectiq-hackathon-pricing-agent-dynamodb
```

### If Pokémon TCG API still returns no results:

**Test the card name manually**:

```bash
# Get the extracted card name from logs, then test:
curl "https://api.pokemontcg.io/v2/cards?q=name:*CARD_NAME*"
```

**Try known cards**:

```bash
curl "https://api.pokemontcg.io/v2/cards?q=name:*Pikachu*"
curl "https://api.pokemontcg.io/v2/cards?q=name:*Charizard*"
```
