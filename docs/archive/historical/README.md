# Historical Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation for completed implementations, fixes, and debug guides. These files are preserved for reference but represent work that has been completed and integrated into the codebase.

## Purpose

Historical documentation serves to:

- **Track implementation history** - See how features evolved
- **Reference past decisions** - Understand why certain approaches were taken
- **Debug similar issues** - Learn from past troubleshooting
- **Onboard new team members** - Understand project evolution

- **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - Specific deployment checklist (completed)

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Reference Historical Docs

✅ **DO reference** when:

- Investigating similar bugs or issues
- Understanding why a feature was implemented a certain way
- Onboarding new team members to project history
- Writing retrospectives or post-mortems

❌ **DON'T reference** when:

- Looking for current implementation details (use main docs)
- Setting up new environments (use current setup guides)
- Deploying features (use current deployment guides)

### Archival Policy

Documents are archived when:

1. **Fix is deployed** - Bug fixes that are in production
2. **Feature is complete** - Implementations that are finished
3. **Issue is resolved** - Debug guides for resolved problems
4. **Docs are superseded** - Replaced by newer, better documentation

## Current Documentation
