# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CollectIQ DevOps is responsible for provisioning, managing, and maintaining the complete AWS infrastructure for an AI-powered Pokémon TCG card identification, authentication, and valuation platform. The infrastructure supports a serverless, multi-agent architecture with Next.js frontend on AWS Amplify, Lambda-based backend APIs, and Step Functions orchestrating AI workflows using Amazon Rekognition (for visual feature extraction) and Amazon Bedrock (for reasoning and valuation).

The DevOps specification ensures infrastructure-as-code (Terraform), automated CI/CD pipelines, comprehensive observability, security best practices, and cost optimization strategies. The system must scale from hackathon prototype (~$50/month) to production growth stage (50k+ users, ~$1,500-2,000/month) while maintaining security, reliability, and operational excellence.

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for infrastructure provisioning, deployment automation, monitoring, security, and cost management across development and production environments.
