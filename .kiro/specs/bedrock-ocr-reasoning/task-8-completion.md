# Task 8 Completion: CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring for the Bedrock OCR Reasoning Agent, including custom metrics emission and automated alarms for operational health.

## Completed Sub-tasks

### 8.1 Add Custom Metrics to Metrics Utility ✅

**File Modified**: `packages/telemetry/src/metrics.ts`

Added `recordBedrockOcrInvocation()` method to the MetricsService class with the following capabilities:

- **Latency Tracking**: Emits `BedrockOcrLatency` metric in milliseconds
- **Token Usage**: Tracks both input and output tokens separately
  - `BedrockOcrInputTokens`: Input tokens sent to Bedrock
  - `BedrockOcrOutputTokens`: Output tokens returned by Bedrock
- **Confidence Scoring**: Emits `BedrockOcrConfidence` metric with confidence range dimension
- **Fallback Detection**: Tracks `BedrockOcrFallbackUsed` as binary metric (0 or 1)
- **Namespace**: All metrics use `CollectIQ/{environment}` namespace
- **Dimensions**: All metrics include `agent=ocr-reasoning` dimension for filtering

**Method Signature**:

```typescript
async recordBedrockOcrInvocation(params: {
  latency: number;
  inputTokens: number;
  outputTokens: number;
  overallConfidence: number;
  fallbackUsed: boolean;
}): Promise<void>
```

### 8.2 Create CloudWatch Alarms ✅

**Files Modified**:

- `infra/terraform/modules/cloudwatch_dashboards/main.tf`
- `infra/terraform/modules/cloudwatch_dashboards/variables.tf`
- `infra/terraform/modules/cloudwatch_dashboards/outputs.tf`

**Created Resources**:

1. **SNS Topic** (optional): `{prefix}-ocr-reasoning-alarms`
   - Created only if `alarm_sns_topic_arn` is not provided
   - Used for all OCR reasoning alarm notifications

2. **High Fallback Rate Alarm**
   - Metric: Calculated as `(fallback_count / total_invocations) * 100`
   - Threshold: > 10%
   - Evaluation: 2 consecutive periods (10 minutes)
   - Indicates: Bedrock API issues or configuration problems

3. **High Latency Alarm**
   - Metric: `BedrockOcrLatency` (P95)
   - Threshold: > 5000ms (5 seconds)
   - Evaluation: 2 consecutive periods (10 minutes)
   - Indicates: Performance degradation impacting user experience

4. **Low Confidence Alarm**
   - Metric: `BedrockOcrConfidence` (Average)
   - Threshold: < 0.6
   - Evaluation: 2 consecutive periods (10 minutes)
   - Indicates: Poor OCR quality or prompt engineering issues

5. **High Token Usage Alarm**
   - Metric: `BedrockOcrOutputTokens` (Average)
   - Threshold: > 3000 tokens
   - Evaluation: 2 consecutive periods (10 minutes)
   - Indicates: Excessive verbosity increasing costs

**Dashboard Enhancements**:

Added four new widgets to the AI Services dashboard (when `ocr_reasoning_lambda_name` is set):

1. **OCR Reasoning Latency**: Time series showing Average, P95, and P99 latency
2. **OCR Reasoning Confidence Scores**: Average and minimum confidence over time
3. **OCR Reasoning Token Usage**: Input and output token counts
4. **OCR Reasoning Fallback Usage**: Count of fallback invocations

## New Variables

Added to `cloudwatch_dashboards` module:

```hcl
variable "alarm_sns_topic_arn" {
  description = "ARN of SNS topic for alarm notifications"
  type        = string
  default     = ""
}

variable "ocr_reasoning_lambda_name" {
  description = "Name of the OCR reasoning Lambda function for alarms"
  type        = string
  default     = ""
}
```

## New Outputs

Added to module outputs:

- `ocr_reasoning_alarms_sns_topic_arn`: ARN of the SNS topic (if created)
- `ocr_high_fallback_rate_alarm_arn`: ARN of the fallback rate alarm
- `ocr_high_latency_alarm_arn`: ARN of the latency alarm
- `ocr_low_confidence_alarm_arn`: ARN of the confidence alarm
- `ocr_high_token_usage_alarm_arn`: ARN of the token usage alarm

## Documentation

Created `OCR_REASONING_MONITORING.md` with:

- Detailed metric descriptions and targets
- Alarm configuration and rationale
- Dashboard widget descriptions
- Usage examples
- Troubleshooting guide for each alarm type

## Integration Points

The metrics are emitted by the OCR Reasoning Agent Lambda function using:

```typescript
import { metrics } from '@collectiq/telemetry';

await metrics.recordBedrockOcrInvocation({
  latency: endTime - startTime,
  inputTokens: response.usage.input_tokens,
  outputTokens: response.usage.output_tokens,
  overallConfidence: metadata.overallConfidence,
  fallbackUsed: false,
});
```

## Requirements Satisfied

All requirements from 6.1-6.5 are satisfied:

- ✅ 6.1: Comprehensive logging of Bedrock invocations with model ID, temperature, and max tokens
- ✅ 6.2: Response latency, token usage, and stop reason logging
- ✅ 6.3: Error details and retry attempts logging on failures
- ✅ 6.4: CloudWatch metrics for invocation count, latency, and token usage
- ✅ 6.5: Complete reasoning output logging with confidence scores and rationales

## Next Steps

To enable monitoring in production:

1. Deploy the updated Terraform configuration
2. Set `ocr_reasoning_lambda_name` variable in environment config
3. Optionally provide `alarm_sns_topic_arn` or use auto-created topic
4. Subscribe email addresses to the SNS topic for notifications
5. Monitor the AI Services dashboard for OCR reasoning metrics
6. Adjust alarm thresholds based on production data

## Testing Recommendations

1. Emit test metrics to verify CloudWatch integration
2. Trigger alarms by simulating high fallback rates or latency
3. Verify SNS notifications are received
4. Review dashboard widgets for proper metric visualization
5. Test alarm recovery when metrics return to normal ranges
